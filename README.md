# Loan Credit Risk Analysis Project

This is an ongoing credit risk project based on real-world loan data (2007–2014).
The goal is to prepare and analyze the data for Probability of Default (PD)
and Expected Loss (EL) modeling.

## Project Status
🚧 In Progress  
Current phase: Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

## Current Work
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Time-based feature engineering (loan seasoning, exposure)
- Encoding of categorical variables for PD modeling

## Next Steps
- Definition of default event
- Probability of Default (PD) model
- Expected Loss (EL) estimation
